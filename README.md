# MedTechPrograms

## Update: 3/11/2025
Updated the database, reduced the amount of universities and institutions, along with the amount
of degree programs and majors. The site will focus on more select majors and programs more directly
associated with either bio or medicine, and engineering. The same goes with the universities and 
institutions, currently focusing only on public universities and institutions that are based in California. 
Since the site is run and managed by one person, these changes are meant to make the process of updating 
and maintaining the database a more streamline and manageable process.
