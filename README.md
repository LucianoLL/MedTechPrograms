# MedTechPrograms

## Update: 4/25/2025
Updated the database, updated the open status for the following programs who have closed their application portals:
- University of California, Davis
    - Biostatistics, Master of Science (MS) 
    - Biostatistics, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)

Finally created a special footer/message when applying the filter since all applications are currently know to be
closed. Also removed some files and moved their contents to their appropriate pages, just clears up some
clutter for file management.
